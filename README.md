# CPGRAMS
CPGRAMS is a portal connected to all the Ministries or Departments of Government of India. 
Currently, system is not multi-lingual, frontend is completely in english. So, we are trying to make it multi-lingual. Search results can also be multi-lingual. 
For example, “Mai school jaa rha hu” has four Hindi words and ‘school’ as one English word. There is no scope currently to translate this whole sentence into one language and then process it.
